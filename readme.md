# Machine-Learning Tutorial: ML Sentiment Checker

This is a collection of files that I will use to learn more about ML. This specific project is a tool that will let a user check the sentiment of some text as positive or negative, etc.

## What will we learn

- Load and prep text data.
- Train a simple ML model with scikit-learn.
- Save the model so you can reuse it later.
- Run predictions in a script.

### Step 1: Install Needed Libraries

```
pip install scikit-learn pandas

```

### Step 2: Dataset

We need text labeled as positive/negative. For simplicity we'll start with a tiny hand-made CSV.

```
text,label
"I love this movie, it was fantastic!",positive
"Terrible film. Waste of time.",negative
"Absolutely brilliant acting.",positive
"The plot was boring and predictable.",negative
"Loved the soundtrack!",positive
"Not my type of movie, I didnâ€™t enjoy it.",negative

```

### Step 3: Model Training

### Step 4: Using The Model
